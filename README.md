# DSA Lab Exercises and Assignments

By Abraham Nigatu

This repository contains a full set of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) lab exercises and assignment solutions.

It is the consolidation of:
- [fazednot/dsa_lab_exercises](https://github.com/fazednot/dsa_lab_exercises)
- [fazednot/dsa_lab](https://github.com/fazednot/dsa_lab)

at the course instructor's request.

In addition to the regular lab problems, the repository contains **special problems** which are custom and manual implementations of basic data structures and algorithms. These are, but not limited to:
- Priority queues implemented manually by hand (e.g., min-heaps)
- Queue special data structures
- STL abstractions avoiding to see how algorithms work

The repository is always refreshed with more advanced solution strategies as well as common coursework.

Split a linked list into two lists where each list contains alternating elements from it
Given a linked list of integers, split it into two lists containing alternating elements from the original list.

For example, if the original list is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, then one sublist should be {1, 3, 5} and the other should be {2, 4}. The elements in the output lists may be in any order. i.e., the sublists can be {5, 3, 1} and {4, 2} for input list {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
